      "User : what is Itolizumab?\n",
      "ChatGPT: Itolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody medication primarily used for the treatment of psoriasis. It was developed by a biopharmaceutical company in India named Biocon. In 2020, due to its potential to be useful in the treatment of severe respiratory distress caused by COVID-19, India's Drug Controller General approved its clinical trial as a potential COVID-19 treatment. Itolizumab targets a cellular adhesion molecule (CD6) that plays a role in the activation and proliferation of T lymphocytes. It works by reducing the activity of T cells, which contributes to inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis and potentially severe respiratory distress caused by infection. Although it shows promise, its effectiveness and safety in the treatment of COVID-19 are still being studied in clinical trials.\n"
